# ⚽ Football Analysis Using YOLOv5  

## Introduction  
This project focuses on detecting and tracking football players, referees, and the ball in videos using **YOLOv5**, one of the most powerful AI object detection models. We fine-tune the model to improve performance and accuracy. Additionally, we classify players into teams based on jersey colors using **K-means clustering** for pixel segmentation.  

By leveraging this data, we analyze **ball possession** percentages during a match. We utilize **optical flow** to track camera movement between frames, ensuring precise player motion analysis. **Perspective transformation** helps represent scene depth, allowing movement measurement in meters instead of pixels. Finally, we compute **player speed and total distance covered**.  

This project integrates multiple **computer vision** and **AI techniques**, making it useful for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.  

📌 Inspired by: [AI Sports Analytics - Football Player & Ball Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBZ6huolkg)

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Player & Ball Detection** – Detects players, referees, and the ball using fine-tuned **YOLOv5**.  
✔ **Team Classification** – Uses **K-means clustering** to classify players based on jersey colors (pixel-based).  
✔ **Tracking & Motion Analysis** – Utilizes **ByteTrack** for multi-object tracking.  
✔ **Ball Possession Estimation** – Determines possession based on player proximity to the ball.  
✔ **Speed & Distance Measurement** – Calculates movement in **meters** using perspective transformation.  
✔ **Optical Flow & Perspective Calibration** – Ensures accurate tracking and position mapping.
