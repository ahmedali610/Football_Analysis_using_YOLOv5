## Football Analysis Using YOLOv5  

### Introduction  
This project aims to detect and track football players, referees, and the ball in a video using YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection model. We will train the model to enhance its accuracy and performance. Additionally, we will classify players into teams based on their jersey colors using K-means clustering for pixel segmentation.  

With this data, we can analyze a team's ball possession percentage throughout the match. Optical flow will be utilized to track camera movement between frames, ensuring precise player motion analysis. Perspective transformation will help represent scene depth, allowing us to measure player movement in meters instead of pixels. Finally, we will compute player speed and the total distance covered.  

This project integrates multiple computer vision and AI techniques, making it valuable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.
